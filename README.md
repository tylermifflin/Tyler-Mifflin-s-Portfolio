# Tyler-Mifflin-s-Portfolio
# The Purpose of this project was to create a Portfolio page that a potential employer can look at to see my projects and style. I have also included links to my phone, email, resume, Linkedn profile, and Instagram profile.
# Usage: This portfolio page puts my best projects in one place and gives links to learn more about me, to help me get my dream job. 
# Noteworthy features: 
-I organized this portfolio page to have a unique header with a title and a nav bar with links that will take you to other places in the page to learn more about me. 
-The page is set up with flex styling to make it adjust to different size screens and still look good.
-I added variable colors to the page to make it very easy to change in the future.
-I used containers to place my images in certain places and have my text go over the image where I wanted it.
-I added alt tags for accessibility.
-I added comments to my HTML and CSS making it easy to follow my workflow.

Here is a screenshot of my page and a link to it:
